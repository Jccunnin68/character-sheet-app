# Terraform Variables Example for ECS Reference Implementation
# =============================================================
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your values

# Basic Configuration
aws_region   = "us-west-2"
project_name = "character-sheet"
environment  = "prod"

# Networking Configuration
vpc_cidr           = "10.0.0.0/16"
availability_zones = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]

# Cost Optimization (IMPORTANT for Free Tier)
enable_nat_gateway = false  # Set to true if you need true private subnets ($32/month cost)

# Application Configuration
container_port      = 8080
health_check_path   = "/health"
app_count          = 1  # Keep at 1 for Free Tier

# Database Configuration (REQUIRED)
db_name             = "charactersheet"
db_username         = "postgres"
db_password         = "your-secure-password-change-this"  # CHANGE THIS!
db_instance_class   = "db.t3.micro"  # Free Tier eligible
db_allocated_storage = 20  # Max for Free Tier

# Security Configuration (REQUIRED)
jwt_secret = "your-32-character-jwt-secret-key"  # CHANGE THIS! Must be 32+ chars

# Optional Configuration
ssh_key_name = ""  # EC2 key pair name for SSH access (optional)

# ECS Configuration
instance_type      = "t3.micro"  # Free Tier eligible
min_capacity       = 1
max_capacity       = 1
desired_capacity   = 1

# Logging
log_retention_days = 3  # Minimal for Free Tier

# Frontend Configuration
enable_cloudfront        = true
cloudfront_price_class   = "PriceClass_100"  # US/Europe only

# Tags
common_tags = {
  Terraform   = "true"
  Project     = "character-sheet"
  Environment = "prod"
  Owner       = "DevOps"
  CostCenter  = "Engineering"
}

# Free Tier Configuration
# - EC2 Instances: 750 hours t3.micro per month (1 instance = 24/7 coverage)
# - RDS: 750 hours db.t3.micro with 20GB storage per month
# - S3: 5GB storage, 20,000 GET requests, 2,000 PUT requests
# - CloudFront: 1TB data transfer out, 10,000,000 HTTP/HTTPS requests
# - CloudWatch Logs: 5GB ingestion, 5GB storage
# - VPC: 750 hours of NAT Gateway (only if enable_nat_gateway = true)

# Estimated Monthly Cost:
# - With NAT Gateway (enable_nat_gateway = true): $35-50
# - Free Tier Optimized (enable_nat_gateway = false): $0-5

# Architecture:
# - Uses ECS on EC2 (t3.micro) instead of Fargate for better Free Tier utilization
# - Single EC2 instance runs containerized applications
# - Bridge networking with dynamic port mapping
# - Auto Scaling Group maintains single instance (self-healing)
