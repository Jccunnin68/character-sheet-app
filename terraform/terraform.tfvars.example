# Free Tier Configuration
enable_nat_gateway = false  # Set to true if you want private subnets (costs ~$32/month)

# Free Tier Resource Limits:
# - EC2 Instances: 750 hours t3.micro per month (1 instance = 24/7 coverage)
# - RDS: 750 hours db.t3.micro with 20GB storage per month
# - S3: 5GB storage, 20,000 GET requests, 2,000 PUT requests
# - CloudFront: 1TB data transfer out, 10,000,000 HTTP/HTTPS requests
# - CloudWatch Logs: 5GB ingestion, 5GB storage
# - VPC: 750 hours of NAT Gateway (only if enable_nat_gateway = true)

# Estimated Monthly Cost:
# - With NAT Gateway (enable_nat_gateway = true): $35-50
# - Free Tier Optimized (enable_nat_gateway = false): $0-5

# Architecture:
# - Uses ECS on EC2 (t3.micro) instead of Fargate for better Free Tier utilization
# - Single EC2 instance runs containerized applications
# - Bridge networking with dynamic port mapping
# - Auto Scaling Group maintains single instance (self-healing)
